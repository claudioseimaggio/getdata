getdata readme
==============

the repo contains an R script that has been built to produce a tidy dataset of the mean of some measures taken 
during an experiment done by some (30)subject doing some (5) activities.
Due to computing resources constrain only 100 observations are been processed by the script.
The dataset from witch the statistics are produced have been downloaded from the following URL:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data have been processed according to the steps defined as follows:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
   for each activity and each subject.
Some explanatory comments have been inserted as comments in the script.
There's also been provided a Codebook file that describes the outcome of the R script.
